Write a function to prints out a list of all the divisors of a user input number. 
A divisor is a number that divides into another number without a remainder. 
For example, 1,3,5,15 is the divisors of 15.


def a(number):
    b=[]
    for i in range(1,number+1):
        if number%i==0:
            b.append(i)
    return (b)
    
number=int(input("Please enter a number"))
print("The divisors of ",number,"are",a(number))
